## Overview

**DiscordCloner v7** is a command-line tool written in TypeScript that allows you to clone the structure of a Discord server to another server you own. It copies roles, channels (with permission overwrites), emojis, stickers, and basic server settings.

The tool is designed for **server owners and administrators** who need to duplicate their own servers — for example, when setting up a backup, a staging environment, or migrating to a fresh server.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🎭 **Role cloning** | Copies all roles with colors, permissions, and hierarchy |
| 📁 **Channel cloning** | Copies text, voice, announcement, stage, and forum channels with their category structure |
| 🔒 **Permission overwrites** | Replicates per-channel role permission overwrites |
| 😄 **Emoji cloning** | Copies all custom emojis (static and animated) |
| 🎨 **Sticker cloning** | Copies all custom stickers |
| ⚙️ **Server settings** | Optionally syncs server name, icon, banner, locale, and moderation settings |
| 🗂️ **Log saving** | Automatically saves a JSON log of every cloning session |
| ⏱️ **Rate limit handling** | Built-in retry logic and delays to respect Discord API rate limits |
| 🎛️ **Interactive UI** | Fully interactive CLI with spinners, prompts, and color output |

## Requirements

- **Node.js** `>= 18.0.0`
- **npm** `>= 9.0.0`
- A Discord account with **admin/owner access** to both the source and target servers
- Your Discord user token

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Discord-Cloner-V7/discord-cloner.git
cd discord-cloner

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

---

## Usage

### Run (compiled)
```bash
npm start
```

### Run (development / ts-node)
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Launch** the tool — the banner and version info will appear.
2. **Enter your Discord token** — it is masked during input and never saved to disk.
3. **Enter the Source Server ID** — the server you want to clone *from*.
4. **Enter the Target Server ID** — the server you want to clone *to*.
5. **Choose a clone mode** — full clone or media only (see below).
6. **Confirm** the operation and wait for it to complete.

> **How to get a Server ID:** Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings (`Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode`), then right-click a server and select **Copy Server ID**.

> **How to get your Token:** Open Discord in a browser, press `F12`, go to the Network tab, send any message, find a request, and look for the `Authorization` header value.

## Clone Modes

### Full Clone
Copies the complete server structure:
- All roles (excluding managed/integration roles and `@everyone`)
- All channels and categories with their position order
- Per-channel permission overwrites mapped to the newly created roles
- Server settings (verification level, notification settings, locale, AFK timeout, etc.)
- Optionally: server name, icon, and banner

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Full clone **deletes all existing channels and roles** on the target server before creating new ones. This action is **irreversible**.

### Media Only
Copies only:
- Custom emojis
- Custom stickers

This mode does **not** touch channels, roles, or server settings.
